# Niyo_Bootcamp_Final_Project_Spotify_Dataset

Project consists of 7 files: The 2 Original dataset (CSV), SQL (Big Query), Excel, Python (Google Colab), PowerBi and the final Powerpoint presentation.

The Original Datasets are from Kaggle and are the ['Spotify Top 10000 Streamed Songs'] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakkesharv/spotify-top-10000-streamed-songs?datasetId=2777839&sortBy=dateCreated&sort=most-comments) and ['Spotify top chart songs 2022'] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveta151/spotify-top-chart-songs-2022) . These datasets are scrapped from the largest streaming software - Spotify, and will be used to see who the top streamed artists were, and if factors such as danceability or energy affect the streaming position of the artist. The columns that I am interested in are 'Position, Artist_Name, Song_Name, Peak_Position, weeks_on_chart, Total_Streams, Top_10__xTimes_, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, tempo, duration_ms'.
